# Capitalism 10.5
Simulation project

A port of Capitalism 9.0 which was written in JavaFX

This is written in Django with various extensions including

* Bootstrap (v5)
* Datatables
* Pandas
* Djangorestframework (not used but included as a possible avenue for styling tables, serving other apps, etc)
* Postgres (available as an option for when we deploy, but currently using SQLite for speed purposes)

Since the project was also a learning process, there have been several versions where various features were tested out

To remember what was done, for each of these I've created a file called DEVLOG where I record what was done as a kind of memo

The earlier versions are still on github but as private projects (happy to give access as a collaborator if interested, but I can't think of any special benefits)

In the DEVLOGS folder I put all the old DEVLOGS

DEVLOG.MD contains a record of what I did to create this version (10.4)

Every time I make a commit, I record this in DEVLOG, or at least, that's the discipline I try to self-impose
