# Capitalism 10.5

Simulation project based on the [General Theory of Value](https://www.academia.edu/49503297/A_General_Theory_of_Value_and_Money_part_1)

General platform for simulating period circuit representations of a capitalist economy such as Marx's Schemas of reproduction, circuitist approaches, physiocracy or plain old circular flow of income.

A port of [Capitalism 9.0](https://github.com/axfreeman/capitalism-9.0) which was written in JavaFX. Details of the rationale and features are still hosted in the README file of that project

To contact me use alan.freeman@umanitoba.ca: I haven't been able to add this to my github profile, for reasons I don't understand.
